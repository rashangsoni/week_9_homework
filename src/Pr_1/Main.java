/**
 * /**
 *  * 1. Create one package with name calculate
 *  * 2. Create two class with name “Calculator” and “Main”
 *  * 3. Create four methods with manes “addition”, “subtraction”, “division”,
 *  * and “multiplication”. All methods are instance methods and it doesn’t
 *  * return anything. But it has two parameters with the names “int a” and
 *  * “int b”. Also each method has System.out.println(). This prints the
 *  * result. Also create one more method with the name “calculateResult”
 *  * with three parameters with name int a, int b and char symbol. Write the
 *  * logic in the calculateResult method that when the user enters first
 *  * number and second number and symbol based on symbol it does
 *  * calculate.
 *  * 4. Write a “main” method into the main class. It has a scanner that takes
 *  * user input. Also write the logic that it ask user to “Enter first Number:”,
 *  * “Enter second Number:” “Please enter one of symbol +,-,*, /:” if user
 *  * enter + symbol result like “Addition of 5 and 10 is: 15” and respective for
 *  * other symbols.
 *  * 5. With the result it’s also print one more message “Would you like to do
 *  * more calculation Please enter “Y” or “N” :” (Hint use while loop if user
 *  * enter Y program asking the user to enter First Number, and if user enter
 *  * N programme should terminate)
